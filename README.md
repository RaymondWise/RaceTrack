Description of game:

In the game of Racetrack, cars race around a track bounded by two concentric closed loops drawn on a square grid 

Each player has a car at an integer position (x,y) on the grid with a velocity vector (vx,vy) that starts at (0,0). Players take turns to move their cars. A move consists of:

 1. updating the velocity vector by adding âˆ’1, 0, or +1 to each component;

 2. moving the car to (x+vx,y+vy).
